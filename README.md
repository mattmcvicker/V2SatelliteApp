# V2SatelliteApp
### This is a web-application created for the NASA Space-Apps hackathon using HTML, CSS, and Javacript. The project goal was to create an interesting, accessible, and interactive web-application that models satellites orbiting the Earth. We decided to come up with a solution that is easy to use and gives users insight on where these satellites are, when they were launched, where they were launched, what they are used for, and more. This application ingests satellite data with SSC RESTful Web Services and uses the WorldWind Web API to create a 3d model of the Earth and the satellites that orbit it.
