Geomagnetic storms impact the electric power grid, aircraft operations, GPS, manned spaceflight, and satellite operations, to name some of the most damaging. Severe geomagnetic storms can result in electric utility blackouts over a wide area.",

Canada was the fourth country to operate a satellite, as the British Ariel 1, constructed in the United States by NASA, preceded Alouette 1 by five months. The name \"Alouette\" came from the French for \"skylark\" and the French-Canadian folk song of the same name. A key device on Alouette were the radio antennas consisting of thin strips of beryllium copper bent into a slight U-shape and then rolled up into small disks in a fashion similar to a measuring tape. When triggered, the rotation of the satellite created enough centrifugal force to pull the disk away from the spacecraft body, and the shaping of the metal caused it to unwind into a long spiral. The result was a stiff circular cross-section antenna known as a \"STEM\", for \"storable tubular extendible member\".",

It remained there as a backup satellite in case one of the operational GOES satellites had a problem until early July 2019, when it started to drift westward and was being transferred to the U.S. Air Force, and then the U.S. Space Force. GOES-13 arrived at 61.5° East longitude in mid-February 2020. The satellite is renamed EWS-G1 and fully operational for the Indian Ocean since September 8, 2020.",

The spacecraft was essentially a right circular cylinder, 1.7 m in diameter and 1.8 m high. It had a near-synchronous orbit and spun about the cylinder axis at a rate of 1 rpm. The spin vector was normal to the earth-sun line and in the equatorial plane of the earth. There were three 3-m booms, a 2-m, and a 7-m boom, all for deployment of experiments. In addition, there was a 101.7-m tip-to-tip electric field antenna. An electron gun and a positive ion (xenon) gun were included, to test the control of the spacecraft potential. Telemetry capability was both PCM and FM, and data could be stored up to 12 h using onboard tape recorders. The planned mission lifetime of 1 year has been surpassed.",

STEDI, managed for NASA by USRA, is a pilot program to demonstrate that high-quality space science can be carried out with small, low-cost (<$4.4 million) free-flying satellites on a time scale of two years from go-ahead to launch. The scientific objectives of the Student Nitric Oxide Explorer were a detailed study of variations in nitric oxide (NO) in the Earth thermosphere. NO is an important minor constituent that strongly affects the ion composition of the ionosphere and the thermal structure of the thermosphere. Specific objectives were to: (1) determine how variations in the solar soft X-radiation produce changes in the density of nitric oxide in the lower thermosphere; and, (2) determine how auroral activity produces increased nitric oxide in the polar regions.\r\n\r\nThe spacecraft was a compact hexagonal structure, approximately 0.9 m high and 1 m across it widest dimension, weighing a maximum of 100 kg. It was launched into a sun-synchronous circular orbit at 530-580 km altitude and 97.7 degrees inclination. It span at 5 rpm with the spin axis normal to the orbit plane and carried three instruments: an ultraviolet spectrometer to measure nitric oxide altitude profiles, a two-channel auroral photometer to measure auroral emissions beneath the spacecraft, and a five-channel solar soft X-ray photometer. SNOE also carried a GPS receiver for accurate orbit and attitude determination.\r\n\r\nThe SNOE spacecraft and its instrument complement were designed, built, and operated entirely at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) of the University of Colorado at Boulder.",

The other missions in the program include the visible-light Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO), and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO).\n\nSpitzer is designed to detect infrared radiation, which is primarily heat radiation. It is comprised of two major components:\n\nThe Cryogenic Telescope Assembly, which contains the a 85 centimeter telescope and Spitzer's three scientific instruments\n\nThe Spacecraft, which controls the telescope, provides power to the instruments, handles the scientific data and communicates with Earth\n\nIt may seem like a contradiction, but NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope must be simultaneously warm and cold to function properly. Everything in the Cryogenic Telescope Assembly must be cooled to only a few degrees above absolute zero (-459 degrees Fahrenheit, or -273 degrees Celsius). This is achieved with an onboard tank of liquid helium, or cryogen.  Meanwhile, electronic equipment in The Spacecraft portion needs to operate near room temperature.\n\nSpitzer's highly sensitive instruments allow scientists to peer into cosmic regions that are hidden from optical telescopes, including dusty stellar nurseries, the centers of galaxies, and newly forming planetary systems. Spitzer's infrared eyes also allows astronomers see cooler objects in space, like failed stars (brown dwarfs), extrasolar planets, giant molecular clouds, and organic molecules that may hold the secret to life on other planets.\n\nSpitzer was originally built to last for a minimum of 2.5 years, but it lasted in the cold phase for over 5.5 years. On May 15, 2009 the coolant was finally depleted and the Spitzer \"warm mission\" began.  Operating with 2 channels from one of its instruments called IRAC, Spitzer can continue to operate until late in this decade. Check out: Fast Facts and Current Status.",

It was a polished metal sphere 58 cm (23 in) in diameter with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable by radio amateurs, and the 65° inclination and duration of its orbit made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth. The satellite's unanticipated success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race, part of the Cold War. The launch was the beginning of a new era of political, military, technological and scientific developments.The name \"Sputnik\" is Russian for spouse/traveling companion or satellite when interpreted in an astronomical context.",

Although the mission was originally intended to last only 3 years, its deployment was long enough to observe an entire 11-year solar cycle. Some of the mission’s most important contributions came from the four instruments onboard that measured concentrations and distribution of gases important to ozone depletion, climate change and other atmospheric phenomena. Data collected from UARS offered conclusive evidence that chlorine in the atmosphere - originating from human-produced chlorofluorocarbons - is at the root of the ozone hole.",

The Viking project was managed by the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) under contract from the Swedish Board for Space Activities, the government space agency. SSC is a government-owned organization responsible for the execution of Sweden´s space program. The satellite was developed by SAAB Space with Boeing Aerospace as a major subcontractor.\n\nViking's perigee boost motor placed this relatively small satellite (286 kg) into a final 817 km - 13,530 km polar orbit, where it conducted scientific observations of complex plasma processes in the magnetosphere and ionosphere of the earth. The satellite carries experiments to measure electric fields, magnetic fields, charged particles, waves, and auroral images. These experiments were supplied by scientific teams from Sweden, Canada, Denmark, France, Norway, the United States, and the Federal Republic of Germany.",

Wind and Polar were part of the stand-alone Global Geospace Science (GGS) program, a subset of the International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program which included the additional missions Geotail, SoHO and Cluster. The objective of the ISTP program was to study the origin of solar variability and activity, the transport of manifestations of that activity to the Earth via plasma processes, and the cause-and-effect relationships between that time varying energy transport and the near-earth environment.",
